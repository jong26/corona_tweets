# corona_tweets
This project used Neural Networks and Deep Learning to Classify Tweets into Positive, Negative, Neutral, Extremely Positive, and Extremely Negative.

Since the dataset is quite small and we have to classify these tweets into 5 categories, it is quite hard to get a fairly accurate model. Nevertheless, I was able to reach 74% accuracy
by finding the best learning rate and fine tuning the model 4 times.
